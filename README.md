    <h2>Attack:</h2>
  <p>*Mantis shrimps are predators <br>
    which kill their prey by hitting<br> 
    them at high speed. They have 
    <br>large, complex eyes and are <br>
    highly colored. <br>
    </p>
    <p>*Mantis shrimps have two methods <br>
      of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> <br>
      or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
    <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding<br>
      and swinging their claws at the <br>
      prey and can cause serious damage<br> 
      to victims larger than themselves.</p>
    <h2>Eyesight:</h2>
    <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile<br>
      stalks and constantly move about <br>
      independently of each other.<br> 
      They are considered to be the most<br> 
      complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
    <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes<br> 
      that it can perceive both polarized<br> 
      light and color vision outside the<br> 
      normal visual spectrum.</p>
